# $FreeBSD$

# A list of current mentee login names and their mentors.  This list is not
# used for anything, but serves as a place to commit to in order to
# "release" a mentee from mentorship since svn cannot do forced commits.

# The full list of mentor->mentee relationships including historical
# entries is in head/share/misc/committers-ports.dot

# Changes in this file can be made without portmgr's approval.
# Please use "Approved by: portmgr (implicit)" for those commits.

# Sort by mentee login name.
